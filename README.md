# Weather Dashboard Web Application

This weather dashboard web application was designed and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch and display real-time weather data for any city using a reliable public weather API. The app includes current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a visually engaging 5-day forecast with weather icons. The UI is clean, modern, and responsive, adapting smoothly to all screen sizes including smartphones and tablets. An input field with autocomplete suggestions helps users search cities efficiently, while robust error handling gracefully informs users if the city is invalid or data is unavailable. Asynchronous API calls are used to fetch data and update the display dynamically without any page reloads. The application is optimized for loading speed by minimizing blocking resources and using efficient DOM manipulation techniques. The entire application is packaged as a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, ready to run offline in modern browsers.

## Setup

To run this weather dashboard web application, simply download the `index.html` file and open it in your preferred web browser. No additional setup or installation is necessary.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Type the name of a city into the input field on the page.
3. Select the desired city from the autocomplete suggestions.
4. View the current weather data displayed on the page, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5. Scroll down to see the 5-day forecast with weather icons for the selected city.

## Code Explanation

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the weather dashboard web application, including the input field for city search and the weather data display area. The CSS file (`style.css`) defines the styles for the UI elements, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the fetching of weather data from the public weather API, dynamically updating the display based on the user's input.
